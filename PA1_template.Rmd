## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r, echo=TRUE}
df=read.csv(file="activity.csv",header = T,sep = ",")
x=!is.na(df$steps)
df=df[x,]
library(sqldf)
df2=sqldf("select sum(steps) ,date from df group by date")
colnames(df2)=c("total_steps","date")
n=length(df2$total_steps)
hist(df2$total_steps,breaks = 10)



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

mean1=mean(df2$total_steps)
median1=median(df2$total_steps)
message(paste("the mean is:",mean1, "the median is:",median1))
## What is the average daily activity pattern?
df3=sqldf("select avg(steps) ,interval from df group by interval")
colnames(df3)=c("avg","interval")
plot(x=df3$interval,y=df3$avg,type="l")
sqldf("select max(avg),interval from df3")


## Imputing missing values
df=read.csv(file="activity.csv",header = T,sep = ",")
# first report the number of missing or NA steps
message(paste("total missing or NA :", sum(is.na(df$steps))))
#
x=!is.na(df$steps)
# first correct the interval ; create a column called int2 which goes from 1 to 288
# which is the number of 5 minute intervals in a day.
# the identifier in the original dataset, interval , should go from 0 to 1440 minutes which is the total number of minutes
# in a day. But it doesn't. Instead it goes from 0 to 155 then jumps to 200 etc.
int2=rep(seq(1,288),61)
df=cbind(df,int2)
# make a copy of the original. This is the dataset that will contain the imputed values
df0=df

df3b=sqldf("select avg(steps)  avg ,interval from df group by interval order by interval")
#
for(i in 1:length(df0$steps))
{
  if(is.na(df0$steps[i])){
    interval=df0$interval[i]
    int2=df0$int2[i]
    newsteps=df3b$avg[int2]
    # newsteps is the imputed value
    df0$steps[i]=newsteps
  }
}
df2=sqldf("select sum(steps) ,date from df0 group by date")
colnames(df2)=c("total_steps","date")
n=length(df2$total_steps)
hist(df2$total_steps,breaks = 10)
mean2=mean(df2$total_steps)
median2=median(df2$total_steps)
message(paste("the mean is:",mean1, "the median is:",median1))
message(paste("the difference in the mean is:",mean2-mean1))
message(paste("the difference in the median is:",median2-median1))

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
df0$date=as.POSIXct(df0$date)
day=weekdays(df0$date)
x=weekdays(df0$date) %in% c("Saturday","Sunday")
weekend=as.numeric(x)
df0=cbind(df0,day,weekend)
# is there a difference in activity between weekends and weekdays? Answer yes , weekends have on average more activity
sqldf("select avg(steps) from df0 where weekend=0")
sqldf("select avg(steps) from df0 where weekend=1")
#
#
# now for the final plot
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)
act1=sqldf("select avg(steps) ,int2 from df0 where weekend=0 group by int2")
act2=sqldf("select avg(steps) ,int2 from df0 where weekend=1 group by int2")
colnames(act1)=c("avg","interval")
colnames(act2)=c("avg","interval")
p1<-ggplot(act1,aes(x=interval,y=avg))+geom_line()+xlab("")+ylab("Average Steps Taken (Weekday)")
p2<-ggplot(act2,aes(x=interval,y=avg))+geom_line()+xlab("")+ylab("Average Steps Taken (Weekend)")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
dev.off()
